## 💼 Featured Project

### 🎓 Insightix – Intelligent Machine Monitoring and Failure Prediction System  
**Graduation Project | Suez University**

A full-stack industrial monitoring platform designed to collect real-time machine data, predict failures using AI, and notify stakeholders instantly.

- 🛠 Developed a **.NET-based backend** with RESTful APIs to ingest and process sensor data streams
- 🧠 Built and trained an **AI model** using LSTM to predict equipment failures before they happen
- 🚨 Implemented a **real-time alerting system** using **SignalR**, triggered by rules or ML predictions
- 📊 Integrated a dashboard UI to visualize machine statuses, alerts, and analytics for operators/admins
- 🧩 Designed a **modular, scalable architecture** for efficient data handling and future IoT device integration

**Tech Stack**:  
`ASP.NET Core Web API` • `Entity Framework Core` • `SignalR` • `Microsoft SQL Server`  
`React.js` • `Python` • `Pandas` • `Scikit-learn` • `TensorFlow` • `LSTM` • `Git` • `GitHub`
